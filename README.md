# DayPlanner

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day, from 9am to 5pm, standard business hours. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Each time slot represents one hour and contains the following:

1. The time
2. A field that holds user input
3. A save button

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.
